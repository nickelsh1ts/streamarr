**Streamarr** is a an open source web application meant to wrap an existing \*Arr ecosystem such as **[Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv/)**, **[Radarr](https://radarr.video/)**, **[Overserr](https://overseerr.dev/)**, and **[Plex](https://www.plex.tv/)** enabling a smooth user friendly experience.

## Overview

Currently under active development Streamarr aims to be a complete (or at least semi-complete) web application for those who heavily manage a plex server with various *Arr applications and many users. Featuring a full front end to make accessing both streaming and backend *Arr services easy and straightforward. Integrating with Overseerr to manage requests and a fully featured invite system to make end user experiences a breeze.
