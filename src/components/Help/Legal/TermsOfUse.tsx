                your location, the bandwidth available through and/or speed of
                your Internet connection. HD availability is subject to your
                Internet service and device capabilities. Not all content is
                available in all formats, such as HD. Default playback settings
                on cellular networks exclude HD. The minimum connection speed
                for SD quality is 1.0 Mbps; however, we recommend a faster
                connection for improved video quality. A download speed of at
                least 3.0 Mbps per stream is recommended to receive HD content
                (defined as a resolution of 720p or higher). You are responsible
                for all Internet access charges. Please check with your Internet
                provider for information on possible Internet data usage
                charges. The time it takes to begin watching
                {process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME} content will vary based on a
                number of factors, including your location, available bandwidth
                at the time, the content you have selected and the configuration
                of your
                {process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME} ready device.
